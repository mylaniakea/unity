## When to Archive

Documents should be moved to archive when:
- The work is 100% complete and no longer needs active reference
- The document is superseded by newer documentation
- The information is historical but may be useful for future reference
- The document clutters the root directory but shouldn't be deleted

## Active Documentation

Current, active documentation remains in:
- `/` - Root directory (README, ROADMAP, MOONSHOT, CONTRIBUTING, etc.)
- `/docs/` - Active documentation and guides
- `/wiki/` - Wiki pages

## Backend Scripts Archive

See `/backend/scripts/migrations_archive/` for archived migration and tooling scripts.
